<h1> HTML and CSS Advanced Structure Project </h1>

<h2>📝 Project Overview </h2>

In this project I will progressively build a complete webpage from scratch, based entirely on a provided designer file.

This first stage focuses exclusively on HTML structure and semantic correctness.
You will not use CSS, external libraries, inline styles, frameworks, or JavaScript.

Later on I will use CSS and come with a complete quality project

<h2>🎯 Objectives</h2>

Recreate the layout as described in the design mockup using only HTML

Apply proper semantic HTML5 elements

Produce a structurally valid, accessible, and readable document

Prepare the page for future styling in subsequent projects

Do and apply CSS styling at the end of this project
